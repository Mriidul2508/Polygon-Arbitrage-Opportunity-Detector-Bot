# Polygon-Arbitrage-Opportunity-Detector-Bot
This project involves creating a bot in Rust designed to detect potential arbitrage opportunities on the Polygon network. Arbitrage is defined as the process of identifying a token that can be purchased at a low price on one Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and immediately sold at a higher price on a different DEX.
